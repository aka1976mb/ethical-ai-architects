# Governance for Ethical AI Architects

Our project is governed by principles of transparency, accountability, and community-driven decision-making.

## Decision-Making Process

*   **Consensus-First:** We aim for broad agreement on decisions through discussions in Issues and Discussions.
*   **Maintainer Review:** Maintainers make final calls for merges and releases, ensuring alignment with project vision and standards.
*   **Escalation Path:** In case of disagreements, we document the differing viewpoints and propose alternative solutions for community input.

## Roles

*   **Contributors:** Anyone who proposes ideas, submits pull requests, or participates in reviews.
*   **Maintainers:** Curate the roadmap, ensure adherence to project standards, and steward the project culture.
*   **Advisors:** Provide interdisciplinary expertise, critical feedback, and strategic guidance.

## Values

*   **Respect:** We assume good intent and encourage constructive critique of ideas, not individuals.
*   **Transparency:** All decisions and their rationales are documented and publicly accessible.
*   **Accountability:** We take ownership of our collective outcomes and are committed to iterative improvement based on public feedback.
