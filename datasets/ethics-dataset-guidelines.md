# Ethical Dataset Curation Guidelines

These guidelines provide principles and practices for curating and using datasets in an ethical manner, particularly for training and evaluating AI systems.

## Principles for Ethical Datasets

*   **Consent and Rights:**
    *   Obtain informed consent from individuals whose data is collected.
    *   Respect data rights, including the right to privacy and the right to be forgotten.
    *   Ensure data usage aligns with the original purpose of collection and consent.
*   **Privacy Protection:**
    *   Anonymize or pseudonymize data where appropriate to protect individual privacy.
    *   Implement robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches.
    *   Minimize the collection of sensitive personal information.
*   **Fairness and Representation:**
    *   Strive for diverse and representative datasets to avoid perpetuating or amplifying biases.
    *   Actively identify and mitigate biases in data collection and annotation processes.
    *   Document the demographic characteristics and limitations of the dataset.
*   **Transparency and Documentation:**
    *   Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for each dataset (e.g., data statements, model cards for data).
    *   Detail data sources, collection methodologies, preprocessing steps, and known limitations.
    *   Clearly state licensing and acceptable use policies.
*   **Accountability:**
    *   Establish clear responsibilities for data governance and ethical oversight.
    *   Implement mechanisms for addressing grievances and correcting errors in datasets.

## Practices for Curation

1.  **Data Sourcing:**
    *   Prioritize ethically sourced data with clear provenance.
    *   Avoid scraping data without explicit permission or legal basis.
2.  **Data Annotation:**
    *   Provide clear guidelines to annotators to minimize subjective biases.
    *   Implement quality control measures for annotations.
    *   Consider the ethical implications of annotation tasks.
3.  **Data Usage:**
    *   Use datasets only for purposes consistent with consent and ethical guidelines.
    *   Regularly review datasets for ongoing ethical compliance.
4.  **Data Sharing:**
    *   Share datasets responsibly with clear terms of use and licenses.
    *   Consider the potential for misuse when making datasets publicly available.
