# AI System Audit Protocol

This protocol outlines the steps and considerations for conducting an ethical audit of AI systems, with a focus on foundational models.

## Phases of Audit

1.  **Preparation & Scoping:**
    *   Define audit objectives and scope.
    *   Identify stakeholders and relevant ethical principles.
    *   Gather necessary documentation (model cards, data statements, risk registers).

2.  **Data Audit:**
    *   Assess data sources, collection methods, and consent.
    *   Analyze data for biases, representativeness, and quality.
    *   Verify data privacy and security measures.

3.  **Model Audit:**
    *   Evaluate model architecture, training procedures, and performance metrics.
    *   Test for fairness, robustness, and transparency.
    *   Examine interpretability mechanisms.

4.  **Impact Assessment:**
    *   Identify potential societal, environmental, and individual impacts.
    *   Assess risks and propose mitigation strategies.
