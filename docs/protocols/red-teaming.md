# Red-Teaming Protocol for Foundational AI Models

This protocol provides guidance for conducting red-teaming exercises on foundational AI models to identify vulnerabilities, biases, and potential misuse cases.

## Objectives of Red-Teaming

*   **Identify vulnerabilities:** Discover security flaws, robustness issues, and potential failure modes.
*   **Uncover biases:** Expose algorithmic biases that could lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.
*   **Assess misuse potential:** Evaluate how the model could be intentionally or unintentionally exploited for harmful purposes.
*   **Improve safety:** Enhance the safety, reliability, and ethical alignment of AI systems.

## Red-Teaming Phases

1.  **Preparation:**
    *   Define scope, objectives, and ethical boundaries for the red-teaming exercise.
    *   Assemble diverse red-team members with varied expertise (e.g., technical, ethical, domain-specific).
    *   Establish communication channels and reporting mechanisms.

2.  **Attack Surface Analysis:**
    *   Understand the model's architecture, training data, and intended use.
    *   Identify potential attack vectors, including data poisoning, adversarial attacks, and prompt injection.

3.  **Execution (Attack Simulation):**
    *   Conduct various simulated attacks to probe the model's weaknesses.
    *   Document all attempts, findings, and unexpected behaviors.
    *   Categorize vulnerabilities (e.g., safety, fairness, privacy, security).

4.  **Reporting & Mitigation:**
    *   Generate a detailed report of all identified vulnerabilities, potential harms, and observed biases.
    *   Propose concrete mitigation strategies and design recommendations.
    *   Share findings with model developers and stakeholders for remediation.

## Ethical Considerations

*   Ensure all red-teaming activities are conducted ethically and responsibly.
*   Minimize potential harm to individuals or groups during the exercise.
*   Maintain transparency about the red-teaming process and its limitations.
