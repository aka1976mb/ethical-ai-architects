# Project Roadmap: Ethical AI Architects

This roadmap outlines the planned phases and milestones for the Ethical AI Architects project. This is a living document and will evolve with community input and research advancements.

## Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1–3)

*   **Core Documentation:** Establish README, CONTRIBUTING, GOVERNANCE, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, LICENSE.
*   **Structure Scaffolding:** Create initial directory structure for docs, tools, benchmarks, datasets, examples.
*   **Vision & Taxonomy:** Publish `docs/vision.md` and initial `docs/taxonomy.md` (v0.1).
*   **Protocols Draft:** Draft `docs/protocols/audit-protocol.md`.
*   **Issue & PR Templates:** Set up basic issue templates (.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) and a PR template.
*   **Initial Issues:** Open core issues for research, tooling, benchmarks, and docs to invite contributions.

## Phase 2: Tooling and Benchmarks (Weeks 4–8)

*   **Audit CLI MVP:** Develop `tools/audit-cli` (v0.1) for generating model cards and data statements from config files.
*   **Benchmark Skeletons:** Establish initial structures for fairness, transparency, and accountability benchmark suites.
*   **Disclosure Rubric:** Develop a preliminary disclosure quality rubric.
*   **First Case Study:** Publish an initial case study or implementation example.
*   **CI Setup:** Implement Continuous Integration (CI) for documentation checks (links, formatting) and basic code linting for `tools/`.

## Phase 3: Governance and Adoption (Weeks 9–12)

*   **Policy Playbooks:** Develop implementation guides for teams and institutions for ethical AI practices.
*   **Community Review Cycle:** Establish structured red-teaming and public deliberation cycles.
*   **Expand Benchmarks:** Further develop and refine benchmark suites.
*   **Partnerships:** Actively seek collaborations with academia, civil society, and industry.
*   **Education & Outreach:** Publish additional guides, case studies, and promote adoption.

## Future Considerations

*   **Advanced Tooling:** Expand the audit CLI with more features, potentially integrating with model serving platforms.
*   **Expanded Datasets:** Curate more diverse and ethically sourced datasets with clear consent and licensing.
*   **Research Publications:** Contribute to academic discourse with research papers on ethical AI methodologies.
*   **Community Events:** Organize workshops, webinars, and hackathons to foster community engagement.

> **Note:** This roadmap is subject to change based on community feedback, resource availability, and evolving ethical AI landscape.
