# Vision

We imagine a world where ethical principles are embedded into AI systems at their core—informing design, deployment, and governance—so that AI advances human flourishing, respects rights, and remains accountable.

## Key Principles

*   **Interdisciplinary core:** Unite technology, philosophy, law, sociology, economics, and policy.
*   **Foundational-first ethics:** Shape models upstream, not as an afterthought.
*   **Open knowledge commons:** Share methods, datasets, benchmarks, and tooling openly.
