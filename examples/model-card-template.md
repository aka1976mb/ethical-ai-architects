# Model Card Template

This template provides a structured way to document AI models, enhancing transparency and responsible development.

## Model Details

*   **Model Name:** [Name of the model]
*   **Version:** [Version number or identifier]
*   **Developers:** [Names or organizations responsible for the model]
*   **Date:** [Date of model creation or last update]
*   **Model Type:** [e.g., Image Classification, Natural Language Processing, Recommendation System]
*   **License:** [e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0]

## Intended Use

*   **Primary Use Cases:** [Describe the main applications and scenarios for which the model is intended]
*   **Secondary Use Cases (if any):** [Other foreseen applications]
*   **Out-of-Scope Use Cases:** [Applications for which the model is explicitly NOT intended or recommended]

## Training Data

*   **Data Sources:** [List sources of training data, e.g., datasets used, collection methods]
*   **Data Characteristics:** [Describe key properties of the training data, including demographics, potential biases, size, and features]
*   **Data Preprocessing:** [Outline steps taken to clean, transform, or augment the data]

## Performance

*   **Metrics:** [List and define performance metrics used, e.g., accuracy, F1-score, AUC]
*   **Performance on Key Subgroups:** [Report performance across relevant demographic or sensitive subgroups to assess fairness]
*   **Limitations of Performance:** [Discuss scenarios where the model might perform poorly or be unreliable]

## Ethical Considerations

*   **Potential Biases:** [Describe any known or suspected biases in the model or training data and their potential impacts]
*   **Risks and Harms:** [Identify potential negative consequences, such as discrimination, privacy violations, or misuse]
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** [Explain steps taken or planned to address identified biases, risks, and harms]
*   **Fairness Assessments:** [Detail any specific fairness tests or analyses conducted]

## Limitations

*   **Technical Limitations:** [e.g., model robustness to adversarial attacks, generalization to new domains]
*   **Societal Limitations:** [e.g., dependency on specific cultural contexts, potential for perpetuating stereotypes]

## Recommendations for Deployment and Use

*   **Monitoring and Maintenance:** [Suggest guidelines for ongoing monitoring, updates, and performance checks]
*   **Human Oversight:** [Describe situations where human intervention or review is necessary]
*   **User Interaction:** [Recommendations for communicating model capabilities and limitations to end-users]
