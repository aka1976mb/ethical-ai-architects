# AI System Risk Register Template

This template helps identify, assess, and manage potential risks associated with AI systems throughout their lifecycle.

## Project/System Details

*   **Project Name:** [Name of the AI project or system]
*   **Version/Phase:** [Current version or development phase]
*   **Date:** [Date of creation or last update of the risk register]
*   **Prepared By:** [Name/Team responsible for the risk register]

## Risk Identification and Assessment

For each identified risk, provide the following details:

### Risk ID: [Unique Identifier, e.g., R001]

*   **Risk Description:** [Clear and concise description of the potential adverse event or harm]
    *   *Example:* Model exhibits biased decision-making against protected demographic groups.
*   **Category:** [e.g., Fairness, Privacy, Security, Performance, Societal, Legal, Operational]
*   **Likelihood (L):** [High, Medium, Low - probability of the risk occurring]
*   **Impact (I):** [High, Medium, Low - severity of the consequences if the risk occurs]
*   **Risk Score (L x I):** [e.g., High-High, Medium-Low; often a numerical score based on a matrix]
*   **Affected Stakeholders:** [Who would be impacted? e.g., Users, specific demographic groups, the organization]
*   **Root Cause(s):** [Underlying reasons for the risk, e.g., biased training data, model interpretability limitations]

## Mitigation and Response Planning

For each risk, outline the planned actions:

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** [Specific actions to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk]
    *   *Example:* Implement fairness metrics monitoring; re-balance training data; integrate explainability tools.
*   **Owner:** [Person or team responsible for implementing the mitigation]
*   **Target Date:** [When the mitigation is expected to be in place]
*   **Status:** [Not Started, In Progress, Completed, On Hold]
*   **Residual Risk:** [Expected Likelihood and Impact after mitigation]
*   **Contingency Plan:** [Actions to take if the risk materializes despite mitigation efforts]

## Monitoring and Review

*   **Review Frequency:** [How often the risk register will be reviewed, e.g., monthly, quarterly]
*   **Reviewers:** [Individuals or teams involved in the review process]

## Ethical Considerations

*   **Ethical Implications of Risk:** [Specifically how the risk relates to ethical principles (e.g., justice, autonomy)]
*   **Ethical Trade-offs:** [Any ethical compromises made or considered in managing this risk]
